# UrbanRisk Intelligence

An end-to-end road-safety analytics platform built from a real accident
dataset: a FastAPI + DuckDB backend that cleans the data, detects
geographic hotspots, and trains a severity-risk model, plus a React
frontend that turns all of it into a dashboard, a hotspot map, a risk
predictor, and a documented API reference for other developers.

  backend/     FastAPI + DuckDB API, ETL scripts, trained ML model
  frontend/    React + Vite + Tailwind client
  data/        raw/ (source CSV, gitignored) and processed/ (DuckDB file, gitignored)
```

## Quickstart

**Backend** (see `backend/README.md` for full detail):

```bash
cd backend
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
./.venv/Scripts/pip install -r requirements.txt
./.venv/Scripts/python scripts/ingest_data.py
./.venv/Scripts/python scripts/train_severity_model.py
./.venv/Scripts/python scripts/detect_hotspots.py
./.venv/Scripts/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8010
```

**Frontend** (see `frontend/README.md`):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env    # VITE_API_BASE_URL should match the backend port above
npm run dev              # http://localhost:5173
```

## Where to read next

- `backend/README.md` — setup, the data pipeline, every endpoint
- `backend/ARCHITECTURE.md` — request layering, why DuckDB, why cursors-per-request
- `frontend/README.md` — setup, folder structure, stack
- `frontend/ARCHITECTURE.md` — data flow, design system, page-by-page notes
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (this directory) — how the two halves fit together

## What's real vs. what's a documented limitation

This is a from-scratch analytics build on a genuinely small dataset
(59,998 accident records — see `backend/README.md`'s data note on why the
raw CSV looks like a million rows but isn't). The pipeline, API, and UI are
all real and functioning end to end against live data — there is no
mocked data anywhere in the frontend. The severity-risk model's accuracy is
modest (macro F1 ≈ 0.35, see `backend/ml/metrics.json`) because fatal
accidents are a small minority of an already-small dataset; this is stated
plainly in both `backend/README.md` and the `/docs` page rather than
glossed over.
